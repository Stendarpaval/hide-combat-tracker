# hide-combat-tracker
This (very simple) module hides the combat tracker from players in Foundry VTT. It is system agnostic.

Players will see a blank combat tracker, while the GM can still see and access it as usual. The module adds a setting to enable/disable the hiding of the combat tracker, so you can toggle the behavior on or off without having to reload your world.
