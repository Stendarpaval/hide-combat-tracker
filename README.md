# hide-combat-tracker
This module hides the combat tracker from players. Players will see a blank combat tracker, while the GM can still see and access it as usual.

Manifest link: `https://github.com/Stendarpaval/hide-combat-tracker/releases/download/0.0.1/module.json`

The module adds a setting to enable/disable the hiding of the combat tracker.
